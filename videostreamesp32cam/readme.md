Based on your code, here's how the Flutter app and ESP32-CAM work together to stream video:

ESP32-CAM Video Streaming Setup
The ESP32-CAM creates a web server that streams video in MJPEG format:

1. Camera Configuration
In videostream.ino, the ESP32-CAM is configured for the AI Thinker model with specific GPIO pins for camera functionality.

2. Web Server Creation
The ESP32 starts an HTTP server on port 80:
```
// From videostream.ino
void startCameraServer(){
  httpd_config_t config = HTTPD_DEFAULT_CONFIG();
  config.server_port = 80;

  httpd_uri_t index_uri = {
    .uri       = "/",
    .method    = HTTP_GET,
    .handler   = stream_handler,
    .user_ctx  = NULL
  };
  
  if (httpd_start(&stream_httpd, &config) == ESP_OK) {
    httpd_register_uri_handler(stream_httpd, &index_uri);
  }
}
```
3. MJPEG Stream Handler
The stream_handler function continuously captures frames and sends them as an MJPEG stream:

Captures frames using esp_camera_fb_get()
Converts frames to JPEG format if needed
Sends each frame with proper HTTP multipart headers
Uses boundary markers to separate frames
Flutter App Video Display
The Flutter app displays the video stream using a WebView:

1. Screen Widget
In screen.dart, the video is displayed in a WebView:
```
// From screen.dart
child: WebView(
  initialUrl: "http://192.168.225.97", // ESP32-CAM IP address
)
```
2. Toggle Control
The main app has a button to start/stop the video stream:
```
// From homepage.dart
RaisedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    if (_isScreenOn == false) {
      setState(() {
        _isScreenOn = true;
      });
    } else {
      setState(() {
        _isScreenOn = false;
      });
    }
  },
  child: _isScreenOn ? Text("stop") : Text("start"),
)
```
Connection Flow
ESP32-CAM Setup:

Connects to WiFi network "JioFi3_04D045"
Starts camera and web server
Prints IP address for connection
Flutter App:

When "start" is pressed, displays WebView with ESP32-CAM's IP
WebView loads the MJPEG stream from http://192.168.225.97
Video appears in real-time within the app interface
Additional Features:

Bluetooth connectivity for motor control
Neumorphic UI design
Directional control buttons
The video streaming uses standard web protocols (HTTP + MJPEG), making it compatible with any web browser or WebView component. The ESP32-CAM acts as a simple web server streaming live video frames continuously.
